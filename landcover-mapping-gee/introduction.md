# Introduction

Welcome to Land Cover Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop will demonstrate a Random Forest classification mapping workflow using a merged Landsat archive. We will cover Image Collection filtering, merging, compositing, and finally, Random Forest model training, classification and accuracy assessment.

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the trinidad-tobago GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings)
3. Create a new script file in your own script repository - name it 'Land Cover Classification - Landsat'. Keep in mind the [master copy](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fkwoodward%2Fcaribbean-trainings%3Abarbados-trainings%2FLandCoverMappingLandsat_CopernicusRefData) is available in the caribbean-trainings script repository. 

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for training and applying a model in Google Earth Engine on satellite data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
