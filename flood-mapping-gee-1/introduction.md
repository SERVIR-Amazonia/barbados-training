# Introduction

Welcome to Flood Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop will conduct a general machine learning classification workflow to map flooded land cover types. 

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the caribbean-trainings GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings).


## Objectives
1. Understand the general land cover modeling workflow
2. Be able to adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification, including different model inputs, training data improvement, etc.
